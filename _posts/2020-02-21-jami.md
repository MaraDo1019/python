# Hello,World.
Hey there,

You know, humans are not very good at self-assessment.

Take this driving experiment, for instance.

Two scientists (Michael M. Roy of Elizabethtown College and Michael J. Liersch of New York University) performed experiments where they asked people how good they would rate themselves as drivers.

More often than not, the majority of people rated themselves fairly highly...

But according to their own internal standards!

Almost everyone thought they were exceptional drivers, even when they objectively were not, because they were judging themselves by their own individual metrics.

This got me wondering if the same was true for Python developers.

I’d say that we tend to rate ourselves in the opposite direction…

Thinking we’re worse at Python than we actually are.

Feeling like we’re stuck in a stage we’ll never get out of, like this newsletter reader:

My aim is to be a Python developer. I started as a beginner using books to cover the basics, and I was able to go to the next level through tutorials.

But now I feel like I am stuck in this stage FOREVER!

That’s how it is… stuck forever in the learning loop. I don’t feel like I’ll ever become an advanced or professional Python developer.

It’s grueling to feel like you’re stuck and not making any progress
